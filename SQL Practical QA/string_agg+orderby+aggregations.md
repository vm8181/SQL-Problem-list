## SQL queries often combine various aggregate functions like ```SUM```, ```COUNT```, and ```STRING_AGG``` with ```GROUP BY``` and ```ORDER BY``` clauses to perform complex data analysis and presentation.
### 1. ```STRING_AGG``` with ```ORDER BY```:
The ```STRING_AGG``` function concatenates string values from multiple rows into a single string, using a specified separator. The ```WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)``` clause allows you to control the order in which these strings are concatenated.
```sql
SELECT
    Category,
    STRING_AGG(ProductName, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ProductName ASC) AS ProductList
FROM
    Products
GROUP BY
    Category;
```
This query groups products by Category and then concatenates the ProductName values within each category, ordered alphabetically, separated by a comma and a space.

### 3. Combining ```SUM```, ```COUNT```, and ```STRING_AGG```:
You can use multiple aggregate functions in a single query to get a comprehensive overview of your data.
```sql
SELECT
    Department,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS NumberOfEmployees,
    SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary,
    STRING_AGG(EmployeeName, '; ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY EmployeeName ASC) AS EmployeeNames
FROM
    Employees
GROUP BY
    Department
ORDER BY
    TotalSalary DESC;
```
This query groups employees by Department, counts the number of employees, sums their salaries, and lists their names (ordered alphabetically within each department), all while ordering the final result by TotalSalary in descending order.
#### Explanation of Clauses:
```SELECT```:
Specifies the columns to be retrieved, including the results of aggregate functions.
```FROM```:
Indicates the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
```GROUP BY```:
Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into a summary row, enabling aggregate functions to be applied to each group.
```WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)```:
Used specifically with STRING_AGG to define the order of concatenation within each group.
```ORDER BY```:

Sorts the final result set based on one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. This applies to the entire result set after all aggregations and groupings
