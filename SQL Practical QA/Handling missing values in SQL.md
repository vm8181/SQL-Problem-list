In SQL, handling missing values (represented as NULL), and identifying gaps in sequences of dates or numbers requires specific techniques.
1. Handling Missing Values (NULL):
Identifying NULLs: Use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators in WHERE clauses to filter rows based on the presence or absence of NULL values.
Code

    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
Replacing NULLs: Use functions like COALESCE (or ISNULL in SQL Server) to replace NULL values with a specified default value.
Code

    SELECT COALESCE(column_name, 'DefaultValue') FROM table_name;
2. Finding Missing Dates:
Calendar Table/Sequence Generation: Create a temporary or permanent table containing all expected dates within a range. Then, LEFT JOIN your data table with this calendar table and filter for NULL values in your data table's date column to find missing dates.
Code

    WITH DateSequence AS (
        SELECT CAST('2025-01-01' AS DATE) AS MissingDate
        UNION ALL
        SELECT DATEADD(day, 1, MissingDate)
        FROM DateSequence
        WHERE MissingDate < '2025-01-31'
    )
    SELECT DS.MissingDate
    FROM DateSequence DS
    LEFT JOIN YourTable YT ON DS.MissingDate = YT.YourDateColumn
    WHERE YT.YourDateColumn IS NULL;
3. Finding Missing Numbers in Sequences:
Sequence Generation and Joining: Similar to dates, generate a sequence of expected numbers (e.g., using a recursive CTE or GENERATE_SERIES if available in your RDBMS). Then, LEFT JOIN with your data table and identify NULL values.
Code

    WITH NumberSequence AS (
        SELECT 1 AS MissingNumber
        UNION ALL
        SELECT MissingNumber + 1
        FROM NumberSequence
        WHERE MissingNumber < 100
    )
    SELECT NS.MissingNumber
    FROM NumberSequence NS
    LEFT JOIN YourTable YT ON NS.MissingNumber = YT.YourNumberColumn
    WHERE YT.YourNumberColumn IS NULL;
Window Functions (e.g., LEAD, LAG): For sequential data, LEAD or LAG can be used to compare a value with the next or previous value in a sorted set, helping identify gaps where the expected difference is not met.
